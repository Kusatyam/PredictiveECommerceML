### Real Time Prediction of Online Shoppersâ€™ Purchasing Intention using Machine Learning
#### Project Overview
This project aims to predict the purchasing intention of online shoppers in real-time using machine learning techniques. By analyzing various features of user behavior on e-commerce websites, the model will provide insights into the likelihood of a user making a purchase, enabling targeted marketing and improved customer experience.

#### Features
##### Real-Time Data Processing: 

The system is designed to handle real-time data, providing immediate predictions as users interact with the website.

##### Machine Learning Models: 
Utilizes advanced machine learning models to analyze and predict purchasing intentions.

##### Feature Engineering: 
Includes extensive feature engineering to derive meaningful insights from raw data.

##### Visualization and Reporting: 
Provides visualizations and reports for better understanding and decision-making.
##### User-Friendly Interface: 
A dashboard for easy interaction with the model and visualization of results.
